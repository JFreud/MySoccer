# Simple Socc
***A soccer game for two***

## SUMMARY
==========================================================================================================================================
It's a simple game meant for two to play on the go, in this case one's laptop. Controls are simple and easy to learn, and gameplay is fair, albeit with quirky little moments for you and your friends to share.

#### General Gameplay:
Players have three main controls. Moving the character, kicking the ball, and sprinting. Through these controls, there are general quirks as well. Players are able to dribble the ball when in contact, however in turn the opponent can easily take it if coming into contact with it. Kicking is only possible when one is dribbling the ball, and can be charged up, or held to it's maximum power. Sprinting is available whenever the opponent is the one who's dribbling the ball, allowing the person to be able to run at insane speeds, before cooling down and needing a break. Hence leading to a simple, yet quirky game of good ol' socc. Featuring custom made poses for each player.

#### Controls
Player 1: WASD to move around, and 'CTRL' as the action key
Player 2: Arrow Keys to move around, and ',' as the action key
